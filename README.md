# java-projects

A compilation of projects written in java

## introduction

In this repository I have compiled a list of projects that I worked on in the language java
during my 2nd semester of my freshmen year and 1st semester of my Sophomore Year at Rhodes College.

These projects consist of many different ideas that I learned within the courses I was taking
at the time entitled: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures/Algorithms.

## main takeaways

The objectives of these projects were to:

* demonstrate an ability to use object classes in programming.
* to implement different data structures and algorithms
* to use these data structures and algorithms practically.
* demonstrate a mastery of java syntax and semantics;
* to implement an interpreter of a functional programming language.
* and to demonstrate an ability to learn and adapt to different aspects of new programming languages and common practices.

## conclusion

I hope that looking through these projects allows for you to see the learned applications of many instances of programming within the language of java and the personality of the programmer (me) through my attention to detail, organization tendencies, and overall eagerness to learn and adapt.
