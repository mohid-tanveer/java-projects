# introduction

In this project I implemented Djikstras Algorithm using a priority queue data structure.

Skills associated with this project are:

* Using created datatypes to implement particular algorithms.
* Implementing algorithms from pseudocode.

# overview

The structure of the project is as follows:

```

`-- src          
    |-- DjistrasAlgorithm.java        -- algorithm

```

The source code for the project is in the `src` directory.
