# introduction

In this project I created a map implemented by a binary search tree and a sentiment analysis program.

Skills associated with this project are:

* be able to create my own data types.
* scan through files and isolate necessary data.
* using data from a map in order to find the sentiment of statements.

## sample interaction

[Here](example.md) is a sample interaction with the program.

## overview

The structure of the project is as follows:

```text

|-- example.md                  -- sample interaction
`-- src          
    |-- BSTMap.java             -- datatype file
    |-- reviews-big.txt         -- text file with reviews
    |-- reviews-small.txt       -- text file with reviews 
    |-- SentimentAnalysis.java  -- sentiment analysis program

```
