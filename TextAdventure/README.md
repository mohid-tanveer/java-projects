# introduction

In this project I created a text adventure game in Java.

Skills associated with this project are:

* be able to use objects more concisely to write complex programs.
* implement simple classes of objects.

## overview

The structure of the project is as follows:

```text
TextAdventure
|-- README.md               -- this file
`-- src          
    |-- Monster.java        -- object file
    |-- MyAdventure.java    -- textgame file 
    |-- Room.java           -- object file
    |-- Treasure.java       -- object file
    |-- Weapon.java         -- object file
```

The source code for the project is in the `src` directory.
