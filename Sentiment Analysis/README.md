# introduction

In this project I created a map implemented by a binary search tree and a sentiment analysis program.

Skills associated with this project are:

* be able to create my own data types.
* scan through files and isolate necessary data.
* using data from a map in order to find the sentiment of statements.

# overview

The structure of the project is as follows:

```

    |-- BSTMap.java             -- datatype file
    |-- reviews-big.txt         -- text file with reviews
    |-- reviews-small.txt       -- text file with reviews 
    |-- SentimentAnalysis.java  -- sentiment analysis program

```

The source code for the project is in the `src` directory.
