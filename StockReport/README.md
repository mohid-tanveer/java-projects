# introduction

In this project I created a very basic "Stock Report" app that gives a user advice on whether or not
they should buy, trade, or hold a stock based on readings from a webpage which is screen-scraped. It also has email functionality.

Skills associated with this project are:

* being able to scrape a webpage and retrieve necessary details.
* build a basic GUI for an app.

# overview

The structure of the project is as follows:

```
StockReport
|-- README.md                      -- this file
`-- src          
    |-- EmailReport.java           -- emailing capabilities
    |-- ScreenScrape.java          -- screen scrapes the webpage 
    |-- Stock.java                 -- object file
    |-- StockReport.java           -- prints stock report
    |-- StockReportVisual.java     -- visualizes stock report
```

The source code for the project is in the `src` directory.
